Aiman Zahry,@AimanZahry,2020-11-01T14:21:41.000Z,"The failure of 2020 for Malaysia is not because of Covid, but a legacy of inefficient governance due to counter productive politics.

The sad part is the government is actually performing at an optimal rate.

Can't fucking wait for parliament to begin and see my fears come true."
