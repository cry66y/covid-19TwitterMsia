MB_SevenTwo,@Tim_HoeRivers,2020-12-01T10:31:53.000Z,"MOH displays #Covid death rate as 0.5%, the formula is wrong as it uses D/All.
Should be D/(D+Recovered)

Rate would then be 0.64%.

Anyway, Malaysia death rate for past few years is around 0.52%.

If using MOH %, then Covid death rate is ""normal""."
