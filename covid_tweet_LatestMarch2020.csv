Asitha Kalinga,@akalinga,2020-03-03T03:21:55.000Z,#COVID19  Seems like COVID-19 matured enough to attack all temperature levels. Last 2 months it was only sustained in winter areas. Now tropical areas too; This is going to become a worst case scenario in coming weeks. Stay awake! No Masks available in Pharmacies #Malaysia
